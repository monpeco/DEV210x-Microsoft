# The C++ Language

If you visit http://www.stroustrup.com/C++.html, you will come across a plethora of information about the C++ programming language, direct from the designer of the language, Bjarne Stroustrup. Bjarne lists a definition of C++ as:

"... a general purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that

* is a better C
* supports data abstraction
* supports object oriented programming
* supports generic programming"

The language started in 1979 and was originally known as C with Classes. Essentially it meant that class files (used in object-oriented programming), were added to the C language. In 1983 it was renamed to C++.

C++ exists under the stewardship of a standards committee and became an ISO standard in 1998 with a revision in 2011 and a minor revision in 2014. It continues to be updated as a part of the standards committee work.
