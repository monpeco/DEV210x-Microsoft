# Inheritance Refresher

New classes can be derived from existing classes using a mechanism called "inheritance".  
Classes that are derived FROM are called "base classes" and derived classes are also known 
as sub-classes.  The following is an example:

```c++
class Vehicle
{ 
    private:
       string Make;
       string Color;
       ...
}; 

class Car: Vehicle
{ 
     // member list includes Make and Color
     // other Car specific members would go here.
};
```

In this example, Vehicle is the base class and Car is the derived class.   Car automatically 
inherits the Make and Color properties and is also free to implement its own properties and 
methods that are specific for a Car.

# Types of Inheritance in C++

C++ supports three different forms of inheritance, public, private, and protected.  Public 
inheritance describes how a derived class inherits all the member variables of a base class, 
both private and public, but is only able to directly access the public members of the base 
class.  All members of the base class will retain their accessibility in the derived class.  
Let's see an example.

**Person.h**
```c++
#pragma once
#include <string>

class Person
{
private:
    std::string firstName;
    std::string lastName;
    int age;

public:
    Person();
    Person(std::string fName, std::string lName);
    Person(std::string fName, std::string lName, int age);
    ~Person();
    void SayHello();
};
```

**Student.h**
```c++
#pragma once
#include "Person.h"

class Student : public Person
{
public:
    Student();
    ~Student();
};
```
    
**Student.cpp**

```c++
#include "stdafx.h"
#include "Student.h"


Student::Student()
{
}

Student::~Student()
{
}

// this line will cause a compiler error    
firstName = "Tom";
```

**Main.cpp**
```c++
#include "stdafx.h"
#include "Person.h"
#include "Student.h"

int main()
{
    Student student1;

    // this line will generate a compiler error
    student1.firstName = "Tom";

    // this line is ok
    student1.SayHello();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example we have a Person class.  We are only listing the header file for this 
example so as not to get bogged down in the implementation details just yet. Next we 
show the header file for a Student class.  Note that the class name Student, is 
followed by a colon and then public Person.  This indicates that Student is a derived 
class of Person using public inheritance.  Also note that the Student class contains a 
default constructor and a destructor.  These are separate from the constructor and 
destructor for the Person class.

In the main.cpp file we declare a Student object called student1.  We then attempt to 
set the firstName variable to a value.  That line of code will generate a compiler 
error even though Student has inherited the firstName member variable from Person.  
The reason is the public inheritance rule and the fact that the firstName member 
variable is declared as private in Person.  We'll cover how to access these variables 
in a little bit.  But notice that the student1.SayHello() function call will work as 
SayHello() is a public function.  Also note that in the Student.cpp class, we attempt
to use the firstName variable directly but the compiler will throw an error against 
this line as well.

At this point you might be asking what use the private member variables are if they 
can't be accessed in a derived class.  The answer is a simple one in that we need to 
go back and think about encapsulation again.  Providing public getters and setters 
for these private member variables is the proper way to gain access to them from 
outside the class.  

As mentioned, there are three types of inheritance in C++, public, protected, and 
private.  This table explains the differences:

| public | protected | private | 
| ------ | --------- | ------- | 
| public members are public in derived class and can be accessed directly by member functions and nonmember functions | public members become protected members in derived class and can be accessed directly by member functions | public members become private in derived class and can be accessed directly by member functions | 
| protected members are protected in derived class and can be accessed directly by member functions | protected members become protected members in derived class and can be accessed directly by member functions | protected members become private in derived class and can be accessed directly by member functions | 
| private members are hidden in derived class and can be accessed by member functions though public or protected member functions | private members are hidden in derived class and can be accessed by member functions though public or protected member functions | private members are hidden in derived class and can be accessed by member functions though public or protected member functions | 

You can initialize members of the base class by calling the base class constructor 
from your derived class.  It is recommended that you make the call to the base class 
constructor as the first thing in your derived class to ensure that member variables 
in the base class are initialized before they are accessed or used in the derived 
class.  The way to call the base class constructor from your derived class is 
demonstrated here.

```c++
Student::Student():Person("Tom", "Thumb")
{
}
```

Note that immediately following the constructor for Student we see a colon and then 
a call to the Person constructor that accepts two arguments.  You can place any valid 
constructor here including one that takes no arguments, in which case the default 
constructor will be called.  Make it a good programming practice to call the base 
class constructor in this manner to ensure your base class is initialized before 
entering the body of your derived class.  Other languages, such as Objective-C, 
require that the base class is initialized before your derived classes.
